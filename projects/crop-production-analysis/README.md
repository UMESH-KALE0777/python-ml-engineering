# Crop Production Data Analysis 🌾

## Problem Statement
Agricultural planning requires understanding crop production trends across states, seasons, and years.
This project analyzes crop production data and builds a baseline machine learning model to predict production.

---

## Dataset
- India Crop Production Dataset
- Features include:
  - State_Name
  - District_Name
  - Crop
  - Year
  - Season
  - Area
  - Production

---

## Workflow
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature engineering
5. Machine Learning model (Linear Regression)
6. Model evaluation

---

## Key Insights
- Crop production is highly influenced by crop type and region.
- A few states contribute significantly to total production.
- Seasonal patterns play a major role in yield.
- Linear Regression provides a useful baseline but has limitations.

---

## Model Performance
- Model: Linear Regression
- Evaluation Metrics:
  - MAE
  - RMSE
  - R² Score

This baseline model sets the foundation for advanced models such as Decision Trees and Random Forests.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Future Improvements
- Try tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Add feature selection
- Deploy model using Streamlit or Flask
